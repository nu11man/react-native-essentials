### What is this?
This repository contains a compilation of essential packages, components, configurations and utilities that you can use when starting a new React Native project with Typescript support.

This reposiotory creates a minimal working application that shows you how to use almost all the installed and configured packages.

---

### How can I use this repo?
To take the most out of this project you need to create a React Native project with Typescript support:

```shell
   npx react-native@0.70.6 init AwesomeProject --template react-native-template-typescript
```

*Note*: React Native 0.70.6 is the latest tested version feel free to chooce another version.

Then you can downdload the `creator.sh` (or copy the content) and store it in the root folder of your new React Native project (where `package.json` is located). You can do that by executing this line:

```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nu11man/react-native-essentials/main/creator.sh --output creator.sh
```

Remember to add execution permissions:

```bash
   chmod u+x creator.sh
```

Then execute it:

```
   ./creator.sh
```

This shell is going to clone this repository, install all the libraries and set up the configurations automatically. When it finishes, it will remove any temporary file from your filesystem including this repository itself.

Now you can run the application with:

```
npx react-native run-ios
```

---

### Addional steps for specific libraries

After the shell finishes, there are some manual configurations that needs to be applied for a few packages to work properly. These additional steps are listed bellow:

- **React Native Config**: In other to get the React Native Config package to work in Android we need to add a plugin to our app, as [mentioned by the lib docs](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config#extra-step-for-android). In the second line of `android/app/build.gradle` write this:

   ```
      apply from: project(':react-native-config').projectDir.getPath() + "/dotenv.gradle"
   ```

- **React Navigation**: After the React Navigation main dependencies are installed, the [documentation suggest a change](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/#installing-dependencies-into-a-bare-react-native-project) in the `MainActivity.java` file which is located in `android/app/src/main/java/<your package name>/MainActivity.java`.

   Add the following code to the body of MainActivity class:

   ```java
      import android.os.Bundle;
      .
      .
      .
      .
      @Override
      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
         super.onCreate(null);
      }
   ```
   This change is required to avoid crashes related to View state being not persisted consistently across Activity restarts.

- **Font Awesome**: With this initial config you will have the free version of the Font-Awesome library (`free-solid-svg-icons`, `free-brands-svg-icons`, `free-regular-svg-icons`). If you are a pro subscriber you'll need to follow [extra steps](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/react-native) to connect your account.

- **React Native MMKV**: Currently the versi√≥n used for this builder is RN 0.70.6 and the latests React Native MMKV versions doesn't support versions prior to RN 0.71. So, if you have created your project with RN 0.70.6 using this builder, we automatically installed MMKV 2.5.1. *We will move to newer MMKV version when the react native version is updates* [Refer to this link to know more about the Android issue related to this versioning](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv/issues/500)
